Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) are *in vivo* cancer models
in which patient-derived tumors are taken and engrafted into immuno-deficient mice.
Once established, PDXs can be used as platforms for drug discovery or
investigation of *in vivo* drug mechanisms.

The PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet) is an
NCI consortium that has generated publicly available for
PDX models across a large number of cancer types.
This data includes genomic characterizations and tumor growth measurements for
a variety of drugs.

My goal is to analyze the drug response data of one or two
cancers to determine if any of the drugs have a significant effect 
on the growth of tumors in PDX models.
Growth data for colon cancer includes ~2700 volume measurements,
7 drugs (and 1 control), and 263 mice originating from 7 unique patients.

Because there is also a wealth of genomic data available as well,
I may incorporate data such as tumor mutation or subtype --if feasible--
to identify any mutation or subtype specific drug responses.
