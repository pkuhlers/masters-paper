                BRAF
                V600E
                mutations are rarely associated with objective responses to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Blockade of BRAF
                V600E
                by vemurafenib causes feedback upregulation of EGFR, whose signaling activities can be impeded by cetuximab.
              
            
            
              METHODS
              
                One hundred six patients with BRAF
                V600E
                -mutated metastatic CRC previously treated with one or two regimens were randomly assigned to irinotecan and cetuximab with or without vemurafenib (960 mg PO twice daily).
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                Progression-free survival, the primary end point, was improved with the addition of vemurafenib (hazard ratio, 0.50, P = .001). The response rate was 17\% versus 4\% ( P = .05), with a disease control rate of 65\% versus 21\% ( P {\textless} .001). A decline in circulating tumor DNA BRAF
                V600E
                variant allele frequency was seen in 87\% versus 0\% of patients ( P {\textless} .001), with a low incidence of acquired RAS alterations at the time of progression. RNA profiling suggested that treatment benefit did not depend on previously established BRAF subgroups or the consensus molecular subtype.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              
                Simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and BRAF combined with irinotecan is effective in BRAF
                V600E

	abstract = {Abstract
            Repeated measures studies are frequently performed in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to evaluate drug activity or compare effectiveness of cancer treatment regimens. Linear mixed effects regression models were used to perform statistical modeling of tumor growth data. Biologically plausible structures for the covariation between repeated tumor burden measurements are explained. Graphical, tabular, and information criteria tools useful for choosing the mean model functional form and covariation structure are demonstrated in a Case Study of five PDX models comparing cancer treatments. Power calculations were performed via simulation. Linear mixed effects regression models applied to the natural log scale were shown to describe the observed data well. A straight growth function fit well for two PDX models. Three PDX models required quadratic or cubic polynomial (time squared or cubed) terms to describe delayed tumor regression or initial tumor growth followed by regression. Spatial(power), spatial(power) + RE, and RE covariance structures were found to be reasonable. Statistical power is shown as a function of sample size for different levels of variation. Linear mixed effects regression models provide a unified and flexible framework for analysis of PDX repeated measures data, use all available data, and allow estimation of tumor doubling time.},
