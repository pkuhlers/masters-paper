Introduction
=============

Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) are *in vivo* cancer models
in which patient tumors are removed and engrafted into immuno-deficient mice.
Once established, PDXs can be used as platforms for drug discovery or
investigation of *in vivo* drug mechanisms (**REFS**).

PDX models have significant advantages over alternative models.
Standard *in vitro* models typically undergo transformations
to ensure proper growth and are kept in growth media that is drastically
different from the tumor enviroment *in vivo*. Additionally, these models
are "two dimensional" and all three dimensional interactions are
lost with cell lines (**REFS**).
PDX models preserve the 3D nature of human tumors and do not require
transformation, thereby also preserving the genomic characteristics of the
donor tissue (**REFS**).


Methods
=======

Tumor volume data was obtained from the PDXnet Portal,
queried for all colon adenocarcinoma.
